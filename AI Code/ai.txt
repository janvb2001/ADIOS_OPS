The ServoBebop2_yolo8.cpp file contains the code that was added to the VISP library.
The added code combines parts from servoBebop2.cpp and tutorial-dnn-object-detection-live-new.cpp.


Inside the installation of the VISP library on linux the custom trained yolo model in the resolution of the Bebop2 camera must be present.

The classID of the desired detected object must match the classID from the model.
See line: 'if (detection.getClassId() == 39 || detection.getClassId() == 0) {'
